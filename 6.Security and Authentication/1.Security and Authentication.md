## Security and authentication

- Authentication is an important issue when creating a dynamic web application.
- Authentication is for identifying users and provide different access rights and content depending on their id. In most cases the application provides a login form with certain credentials to verify a user.
- Authorization is a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file.
- Encryption involves the process of transforming data so that it is unreadable by anyone who does not have a decryption key.
- These are different means to maintain the security of the application by avoiding any unauthorised access.

- Here we will see different ways how this can be achieved in Node applications.
