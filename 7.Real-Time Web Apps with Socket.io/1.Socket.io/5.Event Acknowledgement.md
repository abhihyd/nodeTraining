## Event Acknowledgements

- If we want some Acknowledgements to be send when an event is received, this can be handled in the form of a callback function as a third parameter to the socket.emit call.

```
socket.emit("newMessage",{"text":"Test"}, function (data){
   consolel.log('Got your message', data);
  });

```

- The receiver handles and triggers the callback

```
socket.on("newMessage",(newMessage,callback)=>{
   console.log(newMessage);
   callback('This is from receiver');
});

```

- If multiple values need to be send to the callback, it can be sent as an object {}.
- Acknowledgements play an important role in Real-time applications.
