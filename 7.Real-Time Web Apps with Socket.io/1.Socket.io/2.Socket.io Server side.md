## Server side communication

- Socket.io has APIs to handle communication at server level.
- On the server-side, Socket.IO works by adding event listeners to an instance of http.Server.
- It's possible to attach a Socket.IO server to other HTTP frameworks, that expose their http.Server instance.
- The first standard event to be handled is "connection", which is emitted whenever a new connection is established.
- Apart from the standard events of connection , message and disconnect, any custom event can be emitted using socket.emit and handled using socket.on.
- socket.emit - First parameter is the name of the event(standard or custom) and second parameter is the data object we want to send as part of the event.
- socket.on - First parameter is the name of the event and the second parameter is the handler function on what needs to be done when this event is emitted.
- To add Socket.IO support to a http.Server instance, you'd write the below code

server.js
```
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIO = require('socket.io');
const publicpath = path.join(__dirname,'../public');

var app= express();
var server= http.createServer(app);
var io= socketIO(server);

app.use(express.static(publicpath));

io.on("connection",(socket)=>{ //On establishing a new connection
    console.log("new connection");
 socket.emit("newMessage",{"text":"Test"}); //To emit a new message of type "newMessage"
 socket.on("createMessage",(message)=>{ //To receive and handle a message of type "createMessage" emitted by client
        console.log(message);
    });

socket.on("disconnect",function () {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });

server.listen(3000,()=>{
    console.log('server is up on 3000');
})

```

- The last standard event to be handled is "disconnect", which is emitted whenever a connection is closed.
```
socket.on("disconnect",function () {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });
```
