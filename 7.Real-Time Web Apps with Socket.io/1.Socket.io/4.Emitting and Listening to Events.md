##  Emitting and Listening to events

- Both the server and client's Socket object act as EventEmitters, you can emit and listen for events in a bi-directional manner.
- At both ends, socket.emit is used to emit event to a single connection
- io.emit is used to emit the event to every connection something like broadcasting the event. The parameters are similar to socket.emit.
- socket.broadcast.emit is used to emit the event to every connection other than the sender like broadcasting to all others. The parameters are similar to socket.emit.
