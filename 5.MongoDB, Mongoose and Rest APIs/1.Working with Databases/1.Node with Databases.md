## NodeJS with Databases

- Data is information; a collection of data is called as database. Itâ€™s an organised collection of data in the form of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views and other objects.
- In Real world projects, we would need to interact with actual databases to save and manipulate data.
- Depending on the database, we will have to make use of the 3rd party modules/drivers available to facilitate interaction between NodeJS and the database.
