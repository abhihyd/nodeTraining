## Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

A relational database is organized based on the relational model of data.  This model organizes data into one or more tables (or “relations”) of rows and columns, with a unique key for each row.  Generally, each entity type that is described in a database has its own table with the rows representing instances of that type of entity and the columns representing values attributed to that instance.  Since each row in a table has its own unique key, rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by storing the unique key of the row to which it should be linked (where such unique key is known as a “foreign key”).

Non-relational databases
A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
