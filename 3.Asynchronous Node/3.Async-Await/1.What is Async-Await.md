## What is Async-Await?

- Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code.
- Async/await uses the power of promises but presents the code in a very synchronous way making it more readable and clear. 

Lets's take an example of old school code:
```
const makeACall = () =>
 getData()
 .then(data => {
 console.log(data);
 return data;
 })

```

The above code using async/await will be written as below:
```
const makeACall = async () => {
 var data= await getData();
 console.log(data);
 return data;
}

```
- The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise.
- If the code has return <non-promise> in it, then JavaScript automatically wraps it into a resolved promise with that value.
- The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
- await literally makes JavaScript wait until the promise settles, and then go on with the result. That doesn’t cost any CPU resources, because the engine can do other jobs meanwhile: execute other scripts, handle events etc.
