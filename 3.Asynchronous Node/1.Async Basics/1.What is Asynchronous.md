## Asynchronous programming

In general, asynchronous (from Greek asyn-, meaning "not with," and chronos, meaning "time") is an adjective describing objects or events that are not coordinated in time.

Asynchronous programming is a design pattern which ensures the non-blocking code execution. Non blocking code does not prevent the execution of piece of code.

In traditional programming practice, most I/O operations happen synchronously. If you think about Java, and about how you would read a file using Java, you would end up with something like this:

try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
    Session IOUtils;
    String fileContent = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
}
What happens in the background? The main thread will be blocked until the file is read, which means that nothing else can be done in the meantime. To solve this problem and utilize your CPU better, you would have to manage threads manually.

Asynchronous programming is a solution to this problem which makes a call to the time taking IO operation/function but does not wait for it to complete, instead continues with the rest of the execution. The call has a handler which gets executed once the asynchronous operation gets completed.
