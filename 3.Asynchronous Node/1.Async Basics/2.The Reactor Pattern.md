## The Reactor pattern

We will understand how the reactor pattern works and handles a blocking IO operation making it asynchronous.

1. The application generates a new I/O operation by submitting a request to the Event Demultiplexer. The application also specifies a handler, which will be invoked when the operation completes. This is a non-blocking call and the control returns to the application.

2. When the I/O operation completes, the Event Demultiplexer pushes the new events into the Event Queue.

3. The Event Loop iterates over the items of the Event Queue.

4. For each event, the associated handler is invoked.

5. If as part of the handler execution, new I/O operation is requested, it will get inserted in the Event Demultiplexer, before control goes back to the Event Queue.

6. The Event Loop will process all events in the Event Queue.

7. The application exits when there are no more pending operations in the Event Demultiplexer and no more events in the Event Queue.
