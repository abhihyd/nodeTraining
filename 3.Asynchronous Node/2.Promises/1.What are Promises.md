## Promises

what is a promise? Let’s look at a definition:

"A promise is an abstraction for asynchronous programming. It’s an object that proxies for the return value or the exception thrown by a function that has to do some asynchronous processing." — Kris Kowal on JSJ

- Callbacks are the simplest possible mechanism for asynchronous code in JavaScript. Unfortunately, raw callbacks sacrifice the control flow, exception handling, and function semantics familiar from synchronous code. Promises provide a way to get those things back.

-The core component of a promise object is its then method. The then method is how we get the return value (known as the fulfillment value) or the exception thrown (known as the rejection reason) from an asynchronous operation. then takes two optional callbacks as arguments, which we’ll call onFulfilled and onRejected:
```
var promise = doSomethingAync()
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
onFulfilled and onRejected are called when the promise is resolved (the asynchronous processing has completed). Only one will ever be triggered since only one resolution is possible.

```
readFile(function (err, data) {
  if (err) return console.error(err)
  console.log(data)
})

```
The same callback using promises.
```
var promise = readFile()
promise.then(console.log, console.error)
```
