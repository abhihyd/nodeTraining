### Including Modules using Require

- Require is a NodeJS Function which enables to include modules into your application.
- Require is synchronous and does not require any callback.
Require can be used to load:
- File modules: Load our very own files defined as separate modules.
  If the modulename starts with /, it is considered as an absolute path to the module. If it starts with ./, it is considered as a relative path starting from the requiring module.

- Core modules: Load modules which come bundled with NodeJS e.g. HTTP,FS.
  If the modulename is not prefixed with / or ./, the algorithm first tries to search within the core NodeJS modules.

- Package Modules: Load 3rd party modules, packages defined in NPM(node package manager) to handle complex problems e.g. Express
  If no core module is found matching modulename, then the search continues by looking in the first node_modules directory that is found navigating up starting from the requiring module. The search continues till it finds a match or reaches the root of the file system.

  The resolving algorithm is the core part of the NodeJS dependency management, which makes it possible to have hundreds or thousands of packages in an application without any version compatibility issues.
