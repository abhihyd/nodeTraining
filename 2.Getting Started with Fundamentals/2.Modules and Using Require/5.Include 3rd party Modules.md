## Using complex 3rd party modules from NPM

- npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry.
- It enables to Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

To be able to include npm packages in our application, we first go into our project folder and run the following command
```
npm init
```
This generates the package.json file inside the project folder.

- Package.json is the file where we define all the 3rd party modules which we want to use in our application.

To install a module we use npm install as below where we install a utility called lodash

```
npm install lodash --save
```
Generates the node_modules folder in the project with the dependency code.
save - updates the contents of the package.json so it remains as a dependency for the project
This enables to regenerate the node_modules for all dependencies listed in package.json, just by running the command -
``` npm install ```

app.js
```
const _ = require('lodash');

console.log(_.isString(true));
console.log(_.isString('yes'));

```
