### Modules

- NodeJS uses the concept of module as a fundamental means to structure the code of a program.
- Modules are the building blocks for creating applications and reusable libraries called packages.
- Modules are units of functionality
- A set of functions performing related tasks can be bundled into a module.
- A simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.
- Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.

#### Small modules

- The Node principle has its roots in the Unix philosophy which is

-- "Small is beautiful."

-- "Make each program do one thing well."

- With the help of npm, NodeJS solves the dependency hell problem by making sure each package will have its own set of dependencies.
- Node promotes small and reusable packages easier to share, maintain and use.


#### The module cache

- Each module is only loaded and evaluated the first time it is required, since any subsequent call of require() will return the already cached version.
