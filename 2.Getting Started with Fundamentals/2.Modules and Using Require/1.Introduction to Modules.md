### Modules

- Modules are units of functionality
- A set of functions performing related tasks can be bundled into a module.
- A simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.
- Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.
