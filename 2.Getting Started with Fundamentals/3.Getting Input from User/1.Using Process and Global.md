## Global object/ Window Object

- All variables and functions declared in a module are in local scope and can be made visible by including in module.exports and importing using require()
- global is a special variable used to define anything in global scope.
- Using this to pollute the global scope is considered a bad practice as it nullifies the advantage of module system.
- It should be used only if you really know what and why you are doing it.
- The window object is the browser equivalent of the global object, supported by all browsers.
- The window object represents the browser's window.
- All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
- Global variables are properties of the window object.
- Global functions are methods of the window object.
