### Restarting application using nodemon

The application needs to be stopped and restarted after every change.
Nodemon package enables this to be done automatically.
This module can be installed globally to be available for all applications.

Install nodemon Using
``` npm install nodemon -g
```


Once installed, you can run your application using nodemon instead of node and it will keep waiting for changes.
