## Using Node debugging

Using node inspect on the command line, it enters into debug mode.

Command line statements used:
c – continue. It executes the whole code or the code till a debugger keyword
n – next. It executes one statement of code
repl – read-eval-print-loop. It allows you to execute code at different stages and edit the code. It is a useful way of testing code.
Node js code can be debugged using the inspect protocol. It is a useful way of testing code and can be used to find and edit errors. It can be combined with nodemon to be more effective.
