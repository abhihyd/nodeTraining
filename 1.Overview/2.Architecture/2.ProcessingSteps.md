### Single Threaded Event Loop Model Processing Steps:

- Clients Send request to Web Server.
- Node JS Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool to provide services to the Client Requests.
- Node JS Web Server receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known as “Event Queue”.
- Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop”. The name is indicative of an indefinite loop to receive requests and process them.
- Event Loop uses Single Thread only. It is main heart of Node JS Platform Processing Model.
- Event Loop checks any Client Request is placed in Event Queue. If no, then wait for incoming requests for indefinitely.
- If yes, then pick up one Client Request from Event Queue
- Starts process that Client Request
- If that Client Request Does Not requires any Blocking IO Operations, then process everything, prepare response and send it back to client.
- If that Client Request requires some Blocking IO Operations like interacting with Database, File System, External Services then it will follow different approach
--- Checks Threads availability from Internal Thread Pool
--- Picks up one Thread and assign this Client Request to that thread.
--- That Thread is responsible for taking that request, process it, perform Blocking IO operations, prepare response and send it back to the Event Loop
--- Event Loop in turn, sends that Response to the respective Client.
