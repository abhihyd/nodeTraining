### NodeJS Architecture

Node JS applications uses “Single Threaded Event Loop Model” architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients.

Single Threaded :
Node use a single thread to run instead of other server like Apache HTTP who spawn a thread per request, this approach result in avoiding CPU context switching and massive execution stacks in memory.

Event Loop :
Written in C++ using the Marc Lehman’s libev library, the event loop use epoll or kqueue for scalable event notification mechanism.

Non blocking I/O :
Node avoid CPU time loss usually made by waiting for an input or an output response (database, file system, web service, …) thanks to the full-featured asynchronous I/O provided by Marc Lehmann’s libeio library.
