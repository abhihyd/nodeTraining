### What is NodeJS?

"Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient."

The V8 JavaScript engine is an open source JavaScript engine, written in C++, which takes JS code and compiles it into much faster machine code, which is directly understood and run by the system.
It is the engine which is running behind Node and the chrome browser.

Node enabled JavaScript to build applications outside the context of the browser.
It made JavaScript as powerful as any other programming language like Java, Python, PHP etc.
Using Node, we can now
- manipulate file systems
- create web applications
- query and manipulate databases directly
